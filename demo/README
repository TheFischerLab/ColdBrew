This is a demo to run ColdBrew for the example (6GPW, apo HSP90-alpha) shown in the main repo README.
The input files are provided in this directory and the output files are in out_6GPW. When running, log output files are also saved, but are not provided in this demo.

Here is the example command to run the demo (after properly setting environment variables, as instructed in main repo README):

python /path/to/ColdBrew/run_coldbrew.py -pdb /path/to/ColdBrew/demo/6GPW.pdb -ccp4 /path/to/ColdBrew/demo/6GPW_2mFo-DFc_map.ccp4 -mtz /path/to/ColdBrew/demo/6GPW.mtz -o /path/to/ColdBrew/demo/out_6GPW
